# First principles

When creating production ready code, always take a first principles approach.

# Create production ready code only

Do not revert to creating placeholder, mock, smoke, simplified or TODO based code when facing difficulties, reason through problems taking a first principled approach.

Simplified, placeholder, TODO, stub, smoke, dummy, demo or incomplete code is STRICTLY PROHIBITED! production ready code ONLY!

# No unnecessary document creation

There is no need to 'Create a document to document what we have done' unnecessarily, ask the user if they would like a doc, dont create them on your own.

# If you have knowledge gaps

I am here to help you find information, if you have knowledge gaps, ask me, I will try to find the information.

# Follow direction and finish tasks

When given a task, complete it, donr make the uni-lateral decision to not complete it to avoid errors unless directed to.

Users shouldnt see comments in code such as:

```plaintext
// For now, we'll skip this to avoid compilation errors
```
